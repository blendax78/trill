Trill
==============
A web app that uses the Trello API and reorganizes boards into grids.


**Note**: In progress
Basic setup: Requires a config.json to be in the root folder (same as index.php). It should look something like:
```
  {
    "api_key" : "<key>",
    "api_secret" : "<secret>"
  }
```

**To Do**
in index.js, thumbnail size should be determined based on card size.
re-introduce lists
